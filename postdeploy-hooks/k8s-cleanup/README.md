# Cloud Deploy Kubernetes Clean Up Sample
This contains a sample container that can be used to clean up Kubernetes
resources that were deployed by Cloud Deploy. It should be used as a post-deploy
hook. By default, it deletes the following resource types and in this order, 
however the resource types to delete can be overridden with configuration (see
quickstart).

* service
* cronjob.batch
* job.batch
* deployment.apps
* replicaset.apps
* statefulset.apps
* pod
* configmap
* secret
* horizontalpodautoscaler.autoscaling
